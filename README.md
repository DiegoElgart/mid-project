# This is a Mid Course Project

## Added Users component, in there i want to manage the state, maybe i need to build a different archive that works like a db.

### Users Component

1. Gets All Users Data on Users componen
2. Passes to UserComp user using repeater
3. In UserComp brings todo for each user (limited to 5 todos)
4. Checks if todos are completed, and paints border green if so, else red
5. Filters users by query in search input, checks in name and email
